#Spam-Email-Detection

This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages based on their content. Using Scikit-learn and a bag-of-words approach with CountVectorizer, the model learns from labeled SMS messages to classify new, unseen messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a prediction function. It demonstrates the core concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning for text classification.
